### `-mpmd-pipeline-scheduler`

_Reorders the fragments to obtain a given pipeline schedule._

Reorders fragments according to a pipeline schedule. The scheduling
algorithm relies on a _happens before_ function that takes two fragments
`f1` and `f2` as arguments and checks if `f1` *must be* scheduled before
`f2`. This function requires that:
  - `f1` and `f2` are assigned to the same mesh,
  - `f1` and `f2` are both scheduling units (i.e., user defined fragments
  with call_counters defined), and
  - `f1` does not depend on `f2` and `f2` does not depend on `f1`.
And it should be enough to express many state-of-the-art pipeline schedules.

For each fragment `f1` that must be scheduled before `f2`, the scheduler
pass creates a control-dependency from `f1` to `f2`. Then, it applies a
topological sort on the module to guarantee that all dependencies are
respected (and the program is in a valid SSA form). Finally, the pass
removes from the graph any control-dependency introduced.

#### Options

```
-must-happen-before : A comparator that determines whether a fragment must be scheduled before another. Can be parsed from a built-in `PipelineSchedule` as follows: `builtin:<schedule-as-string>`.
```

### `-mpmd-remat-fragment`

_Rematerializes fragments._

Finds pairs of fragments (forward+backward) that need to be rematerialized
and clones every forward fragment before its backward user, replace all
backward uses of values produced by the forward fragment with the cloned
counterparts. This can be used for activation rematerialization in pipeline
parallelism.

When `merge_remat_fragments` is true, then we merge the remat fragments into
their consumer fragments.

#### Options

```
-merge-remat-fragments : Whether to merge the remat fragments into their consumer fragments.
```
