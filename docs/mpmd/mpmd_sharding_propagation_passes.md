### `-mpmd-convert-sdy-constants`

_Converts `sdy.constant` ops into `stablehlo.constant`._

Converts any `sdy.constant` op, that isn't foldable, into a
`stablehlo.constant` op. There is no reason to prevent constant folding
since we are stripping shardings away from constants in
`mpmd-convert-sdy-shardings-to-mpmd-types`.

### `-mpmd-convert-sdy-shardings-to-mpmd-types`

_Moves shardings from op attrs to `!mpmd.mesh_tensor` types._

Moves shardings from the attributes of MPMD ops (e.g. fragments, transfer)
to the `MeshTensorType` of their results. Assuming we apply SDY propagation
before this pass, the SPMD shardings are attached to the op's attributes.
This pass moves the sharding to `MeshTensorType`s since later passes require
the type to contain a sharding.

This pass also removes any sharding from ops that don't have a
`MeshTensorType`, i.e., ops inside `mpmd.fragment` ops.

### `-mpmd-enforce-user-shardings`

_Enforces the user specified shardings for inputs and outputs._

Enforces the input and output shardings of fragments that take function
arguments or produce function results respectively, to be the ones specified
by the user, i.e., the input and outputs shardings of the function.

After this pass, fragment and transfer users of function arguments and
producers of function results should have the same shardings as the ones
specified by the user. If the user did not specify a sharding for an input
or output, this pass keeps the sharding that propagation assigned.

Precondition:
- The user shardings are set on the function's arguments and results as
  attributes.
- The fragment shardings are set on `in_shardings` and `out_shardings`
  attributes.

### `-mpmd-extract-reshards-from-inter-mesh-transfers`

_Moves SPMD resharding around an inter-mesh transfer to inside a fragment._

Ensures that all inter-mesh transfers do not (SPMD) reshard the array (their
in and out shardings are the same), by updating the types of
producer/consumer fragments or by creating inferred fragments for
non-fragment producers/consumers.

This is needed as MPMD runtimes have limitations w.r.t. supported
reshardings.

This pass is only applied to MPMD functions in global view and with a
homogeneous topology.

Precondition: all shardings are specified as op attributes and not in types.

### `-mpmd-simplify-program`

_Removes redundant arg/results from fragments._

Simplifies a fragment or loop, its operands and results, and their
corresponding block arguments and return values.
